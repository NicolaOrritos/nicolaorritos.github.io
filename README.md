Hi, I'm Nicola Orritos, software craftsman (and a few more things).

I live in Cagliari, Sardinia and I work as a software architect at [Xorovo](http://www.xorovo.com "Xorovo"), an [Applix Group](http://www.applixgroup.com/ "Applix Group") company.
I was born October, 22 in 1983 and I've always lived in Sardinia.
