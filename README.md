What ends the night is in turn ended by the night
=================================================

## Intro
Hi, I'm Nicola Orritos: a proud son, a stubborn boyfriend, an older brother, a Sardinian man and a software craftsman.
These pages are clearly a work-in-progress, but they're going to host relevant info about myself and my projects really soon.

## Some more about myself
I live in Cagliari, Sardinia and I work as a software analyst/developer at [Xorovo](http://www.xorovo.com "Xorovo"), an [Applix Group](http://www.applixgroup.com/ "Applix Group") company.

## Interests
Altough I really like computer science I'm really into other things as well: books, cycling, gardening, great outdoors, green tech, design and some more.
