What ends the night is in turn ended by the night

## Intro
Hi, I'm Nicola Orritos: a proud son, a stubborn boyfriend, an older brother, a Sardinian man and a software craftsman.
These pages are clearly a work-in-progress, but they're going to host relevant info about myself and my projects really soon.

## Some more about myself
I live in Cagliari, Sardinia and I work as a software analyst/developer at [Xorovo](www.xorovo.com "Xorovo"), an [Applix Group](http://www.applixgroup.com/ "Applix Group") company.
