Hi, I'm Nicola Orritos: a proud son, a stubborn boyfriend, an older brother, a Sardinian man and a software craftsman.

I live in Cagliari, Sardinia and I work as a software analyst/developer at [Xorovo](http://www.xorovo.com "Xorovo"), an [Applix Group](http://www.applixgroup.com/ "Applix Group") company.
I was born October, 22 in 1983 and I've always lived in Sardinia.

### Interests
Altough I really like computer science I'm really into other things as well: books, cycling, gardening, great outdoors, green tech, design and some more.
