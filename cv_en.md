# Nicola Orritos - Curriculum Vitae

<img src="images/mezzobusto.small.jpg" width="160" height="160">  
I was born in Ozieri October, 22 in 1983.  
I currently live in Cagliari.  

## Experience
#### October  2002
Started a CS degree at University of Cagliari.

#### February 2006
Graduated with 107/110.

#### March 2006
First job with former _Sarda EDP_: I took part in the creation of a trouble-ticket management system for Tiscali Italia call-centers.

#### January 2008
Recruited by Xorovo (at the time a startup spin-off of the Cagliari University) as C/Java analyst and developer.

#### February 2010
Two years with _Akhela_ were I worked as a requirements analyst and developer with the team that created the daemon responsible for handling consumer multimedia devices connected to the _EntryNAV_ Infotainment system, developed by __Magneti Marelli__ for __BMW__.  
For a brief time I was also in charge of handling bugs and Change Requests for the same team, collaborating with teams from Akhela, BMW, Magneti Marelli, Windriver and other companies involved in the project.

#### April 2012
Back at Xorovo, now an _Applix Group_ company, where I took part in a project for __Vodafone Italia__ as a backend Java developer.  
_Vodafone Calcio_ is the streaming app for Italy's _Serie A_ tournament; this app also includes a social platform where tweets and facebook posts can be exchanged among people watching the same match.

#### Now
At Xorovo I'm web architect and lead developer of the web magazines viewer, part of the company's flagship product _Viewer+_.  
For that project I am also a developer of the desktop versions, one based on _Qt 5_ (both for OSX and for Windows) and the other based on Microsoft _"Modern" UI_ and written in C#.  
I'm also creator and mantainer of some personal projects: part of them are based on NodeJS, part are HTML5 web-apps, part are Cordova/Phonegap apps.  
One of these projects, __"bagarino"__, has been _battle-tested_ on production servers here at Xorovo.

## Skills
During these years I developed a strong OOP background in many languages, mainly C++, C# and Java; currently I'm combining it with asyncronous programming and Javascript.  
Server-side Javascript is the platform I'm studying the most: I'm studying ES6 innovations and working with Express, Grunt, Jade, Cheerio, Cordova node module and others.  
I do a really good job at modelling systems and their data as well as re-engineering them (given they're not too much _spaghetti-designed_, that is).  
I'm a proficient developer on different platforms: NodeJS, HTML5 and CSS3, Linux, server-side Java, Qt (both Windows and OSX) and Microsoft Windows (both desktop and tablets).  
I know pretty well some SQL solutions and NoSQL ones: I worked in the past with MySQL and Postgres and now I'm developing solutions based on Redis and RethinkDB.  
I have some elements of Android, iOS and Windows Phone development as well as Cordova/Phonegap.  
I know a decent amount of PHP, Bash and C.  
Finally I work with Apache, Monit and I know how to configure Linux-based systems.
