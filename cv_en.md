## Skills
I developed a strong OOP background in many languages (mainly C++, C# and Java) but I'm currently absorbed by asyncronous programming with Javascript and REST architectures.  
Server-side Javascript is the platform I'm versed the most: I've been an enthusiast adopter of ES6 and Promises, working with Express, Restify, Grunt, many different and popular node modules and the Node.js ecosystem in general, contributing to the adoption of microservices-based architectures in production environments.

I know pretty well some SQL solutions and NoSQL ones: I worked in the past with MySQL and Postgres and I developed solutions based on Redis and MongoDB/RethinkDB.  
I have some elements of Electron, Android and iOS.
I know a fairly decent amount of Bash and C.  
I worked with Apache, Nginx and I know how to configure Linux-based systems (Arch Linux, Amazon AMI Linux, Debian-based).

Lately I'm focusing my efforts in studying Data Science with Python, mainly because I'm eager to dive in the Machine Learning field.  
I also studied two blockchain platforms, Bitcoin and Ethereum, focusing my efforts on the Solidity smart-contracts language and on _Dapps_ (Ethereum _Distributed apps_) development using _web3.js_.


## Education

#### October 2002 - February 2006
Bachelor Computer Science degree at University of Cagliari.  
Graduated with 107/110.


## Extra-curricula
I love reading books about the most disparate arguments: neuro-science, mankind history, astrophisics and Science in general.  
I'm a Tai Chi practitioner, I like MTB and Nature and I'm a strong believer in Environment protection.
