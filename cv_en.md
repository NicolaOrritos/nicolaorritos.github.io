Back at Xorovo (which became an _Applix Group_ company in the meanwhile) where I took part in a project for __Vodafone Italia__ as a backend Java developer.

Teaching myself Python, Data Science and Machine Learning during my free-time.


## Skills
During these years I developed a strong OOP background in many languages (mainly C++, C# and Java) but I'm currently absorbed by asyncronous programming and Javascript, as well as REST architectures.  
Server-side Javascript is the platform I'm versed the most: I've been an enthusiast adopter of ES6 and Promises, working with Express, Restify, Grunt, many different and popular node modules and the NodeJS ecosystem in general, contributing to the adoption of microservices-based architectures in production environments.
In general I do a really good job at modelling systems and their data.  

I know pretty well some SQL solutions and NoSQL ones: I worked in the past with MySQL and Postgres and I developed solutions based on Redis and MongoDB/RethinkDB.  
I have some elements of Electron, Android, iOS and Windows Phone development as well as Cordova/Phonegap.
I know a decent amount of PHP, Bash and C.  
I worked with Apache, Nginx and I know how to configure Linux-based systems (Arch Linux, Amazon AMI Linux, Debian-based).  

Lately I'm focusing my efforts in studying Data Science with Python, mainly because I'm eager to dive in the Machine Learning field.
